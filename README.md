# Sports-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
# Description:
This repository contains Python code for performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of sports-related tweets. The code covers various text processing techniques including tokenization, punctuation removal, stop words removal, stemming, and feature extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec). It also includes text summarization using word frequency analysis and sentence scoring. Additionally, the repository provides a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) for sentiment prediction based on TF-IDF and Bag of Words features.

# Features:

1) Data Preprocessing: The repository preprocesses the sports-related tweet dataset by performing the following tasks:

   Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
   Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
   Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks from the text.
   Stopwords Removal: Eliminating common words (stopwords) that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text.
   Stemming: Reducing words to their root form to normalize the text.

2) Feature Extraction:

   Bag of Words (BoW): A technique that represents text data as a matrix of word counts.
   TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A method to reflect the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
   Word2Vec: A word embedding technique that represents words in a continuous vector space.

3) Text Summarization:

   Utilizes word frequency analysis and sentence scoring to generate summaries of the input text.
4) Sentiment Analysis:

   Trains a Random Forest Classifier using TF-IDF and Bag of Words features to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of sports-related tweets.

# Explanation:

The repository demonstrates how to preprocess text data to prepare it for analysis. This involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and stopwords, and stemming words to their root forms.
It showcases different techniques for feature extraction from text data, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec, which are commonly used in natural language processing tasks.
Text summarization techniques are implemented to automatically generate concise summaries of sports-related articles or tweets.
Finally, the repository includes a sentiment analysis model trained on the preprocessed text data to predict whether a sports-related tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment.
